    <font color="white" face="Comic Sans">One thing about me that is important enough to know is that I at first is I am  a very shy individual.
        But once I get to know people and are comfortable with them, I am great. I have a tough shell but on the inside I am soft. I am also a very principled 
        person and stand strong on what is right and wrong.</font>
